This is an fiverr clint application. Project requirment are bellow.

So there will be 3 roles for the users (Normal, Manager and Admin). All of the users accounts will be created by an admin, you won't be able to register yourself (so you will only have the login page, no register).

Now both a Normal and a Manager account will be able to create patients as entries (patients won't have an account, this is an internal tool for the doctors) the difference is, Manager accounts can create and read patients from the whole database, where Normal users can only create and read patients that they have access to (either they created themselves or a Manager created one for them).

Same with the appointments, the only thing is appointments will have a date and time and we'll appear on the calendar or upcoming list or whatever you think will be easier, make more sense.

Admin users will basically have the manager Role, but will also have access to the dashboard where they will handle users (Normal, Manager and other Admins) they will create, read etc.
